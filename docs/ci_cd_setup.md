# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

[← Back to Developer Hub](index.md)

## Overview

The STRling project uses an automated CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that handles both continuous integration (testing) and continuous deployment (publishing to PyPI and NPM).

## Pipeline Architecture

STRling employs a **Matrix-Driven CI/CD Strategy** that validates all 17 language bindings in parallel before any deployment occurs.

### CI Strategy: The Test Matrix

The `test-matrix` job is the core validation engine that runs on every push and pull request to `main`, `dev`, and `feature/**` branches.

**Matrix Configuration:**
-   **Languages Tested:** All 17 bindings run in parallel:
    -   C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Dart, Lua, Perl, PHP, R, Swift, TypeScript, F#
-   **Parallel Execution:** Each language runs independently on its own Ubuntu runner
-   **Fail-Fast Disabled:** All languages complete testing even if one fails, ensuring complete visibility

**Workflow Per Language:**
1. **🔧 Universal Setup:** Makes `./strling` executable
2. **📦 Install Dependencies:** Runs `./strling setup <lang>` to configure language-specific toolchain
3. **🔨 Compile (Build):** Runs `./strling build <lang>` if the language requires compilation
4. **🧪 Execute Tests:** Runs `./strling test <lang>` to validate all functionality

**Key Benefits:**
-   **Rapid Feedback:** Parallel execution completes in ~5-10 minutes instead of sequential hours
-   **Full Coverage:** Every binding is tested on every commit
-   **Isolation:** Language-specific failures don't block other languages from completing

### Certification: The Omega Audit (Gatekeeper)

The `audit-conformance` job acts as the **quality gatekeeper** for the entire ecosystem.

-   **Triggers:** Runs after `test-matrix` completes successfully
-   **Purpose:** Validates conformance test coverage across all bindings
-   **Script:** `python tooling/audit_conformance.py`
-   **Requirements:**
    -   All bindings must achieve `🟢 CERTIFIED` status
    -   Zero test skips (no `SKIPPED` or `ignored` tests)
    -   Zero warnings in build/test output
    -   Semantic verification tests must pass (duplicate groups, invalid ranges)
    -   Test counts must be explicit integers (not "Unknown")
-   **Blocking Behavior:** If audit fails, deployment jobs are prevented from running

**Note:** While the CI runs `audit_conformance.py`, the more comprehensive `audit_omega.py` should be run locally before submitting PRs to ensure full compliance.

### CD Strategy: All-or-Nothing Deployment

Deployment jobs execute **only** when all quality gates pass:

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. A git tag matching `v*` pattern is pushed (e.g., `v3.0.0-alpha`)
2. The `test-matrix` job completes successfully for all 17 bindings
3. The `audit-conformance` job passes

**Deployment Jobs:** Each binding has its own deployment job that:
-   Verifies version consistency between the git tag and binding manifest
-   Checks if the version already exists in the target registry (idempotency)
-   Publishes to the appropriate package registry if version is new

**Target Registries by Language:**
-   **Python:** PyPI (via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`)
-   **TypeScript:** NPM (package: `@thecyberlocal/strling`)
-   **Rust:** Crates.io (package: `strling_core`)
-   **C#:** NuGet (package: `STRling`)
-   **F#:** NuGet (package: `STRling.FSharp`)
-   **Ruby:** RubyGems (package: `strling`)
-   **Dart:** Pub.dev (package: `strling`)
-   **Kotlin:** Maven Central
-   **Lua:** LuaRocks (package: `strling`)
-   **Go, Swift, C, C++, PHP, R:** Tag validation only (distributed via git)
-   **Java, Perl:** Deployment not yet implemented

**Idempotency Protection:**
-   Before publishing, the `check_version_exists.py` script validates if the version already exists
-   If the version exists, the deployment step is skipped with a success status
-   This prevents CI failures when re-running deployments or creating tags on already-published versions

**Version Management:**
-   **SSOT:** `bindings/python/pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for versioning
-   **Propagation:** The `sync_versions.py` script propagates the Python version to all other bindings
-   **Rule:** Never manually edit version numbers in `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or other manifests

## Required GitHub Secrets

For deployment to package registries, configure these secrets in your repository at **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**:

### Python: PYPI_API_TOKEN

**How to create:**

1. Log in to [PyPI](https://pypi.org)
2. Go to Account Settings > API tokens
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Set scope to "Entire account" or limit to "STRling"
5. Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

**GitHub Configuration:**
- Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
- Value: Your PyPI token

### TypeScript: NPM_TOKEN

**How to create:**

1. Log in to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
2. Go to Account Settings > Access Tokens
3. Click "Generate New Token" > "Automation"
4. Copy the token

**GitHub Configuration:**
- Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
- Value: Your NPM automation token

### C#/F#: NUGET_KEY

**How to create:**

1. Log in to [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org)
2. Go to API Keys
3. Create a new API key with push permissions
4. Copy the key

**GitHub Configuration:**
- Name: `NUGET_KEY`
- Value: Your NuGet API key

### Ruby: RUBYGEMS_KEY

**How to create:**

1. Log in to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org)
2. Go to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key

**GitHub Configuration:**
- Name: `RUBYGEMS_KEY`
- Value: Your RubyGems API key

### Rust: CARGO_TOKEN

**How to create:**

1. Log in to [Crates.io](https://crates.io)
2. Go to Account Settings > API Tokens

### Kotlin: Maven Central Credentials

**Required Secrets:**
- `MAVEN_USERNAME`: Your Sonatype OSSRH username
- `MAVEN_PASSWORD`: Your Sonatype OSSRH password
- `GPG_KEY`: Your GPG private key for signing artifacts

**How to create:** Follow the [Maven Central publishing guide](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/)

### Lua: LUA_API_KEY

**How to create:**

1. Log in to [LuaRocks.org](https://luarocks.org)
2. Go to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key

### Perl: PAUSE Credentials

**Required Secrets:**
- `PAUSE_USERNAME`: Your PAUSE (CPAN) username
- `PAUSE_PASSWORD`: Your PAUSE password

**How to obtain:** Register at [PAUSE](https://pause.perl.org/)

### Dart: No Secret Required

Dart publishing uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. Ensure the repository has `id-token: write` permission (already configured in the workflow).

### Languages Without Registry Deployment

The following bindings are distributed via git tags only and don't require secrets:
- **C**, **C++**, **Go**, **Swift**, **PHP**, **R**

These deployments perform tag validation only.

## Workflow Triggers

The pipeline is triggered by:

### Push Events

-   **Branches:** `main`, `dev`, `feature/**`
-   **Tags:** `v*` (triggers deployment)
-   **Path filters:** Only runs when these paths change:
    -   `bindings/**`
    -   `spec/**`
    -   `tests/**`
    -   `tooling/**`
    -   `.github/workflows/**`

### Pull Request Events

-   Same path filters as push events
-   Runs CI jobs only (no deployment)

## Branching Strategy

This workflow enforces the following branching model:

1. **`feature/**` branches**: Development work happens here
    - CI runs on every push (test-matrix + audit-conformance)
    - No deployment occurs

2. **`dev` branch**: Integration and pre-release testing
    - CI runs on every push (test-matrix + audit-conformance)
    - No deployment occurs

3. **`main` branch**: Production-ready code
    - CI runs on every push (test-matrix + audit-conformance)
    - No automatic deployment on push
    - **Deployment occurs only when a tag is pushed** (e.g., `git tag v3.0.0 && git push --tags`)

## Testing the Pipeline

### Test CI Only

To test the CI jobs without triggering deployment:

1. Push to a `feature/*` or `dev` branch
2. Or create a pull request to any branch
3. Monitor the Actions tab to see test-matrix running all 17 bindings in parallel

### Test Full CI/CD

To test the complete pipeline including deployment:

1. Ensure all required secrets are configured (see Required GitHub Secrets section)
2. Ensure version is updated in `bindings/python/pyproject.toml` (SSOT)
3. Run `python3 tooling/sync_versions.py --write` to propagate versions
4. Commit and merge to `main`
5. Create and push a tag: `git tag v3.0.0-alpha && git push --tags`
6. Monitor the workflow run in the Actions tab

## Deployment Checklist

Before creating a release tag (which triggers deployment):

-   [ ] All tests pass locally: `./strling test all`
-   [ ] Omega audit passes: `python3 tooling/audit_omega.py` shows `🟢 CERTIFIED` for all 17 bindings
-   [ ] Version number updated in `bindings/python/pyproject.toml` (SSOT)
-   [ ] Run version propagation: `python3 tooling/sync_versions.py --write`
-   [ ] Changelog updated (if applicable)
-   [ ] Documentation updated
-   [ ] All required secrets configured (see below)
-   [ ] Create git tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z` (match the version in pyproject.toml)
-   [ ] Push tag: `git push --tags`

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails: "Invalid credentials"

-   **Python:** Verify `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is set correctly and has upload permissions
-   **TypeScript:** Verify `NPM_TOKEN` is set correctly and has publish permissions
-   **C#/F#:** Verify `NUGET_KEY` is set correctly
-   **Dart:** Verify repository has `id-token: write` permission (OIDC authentication)
-   **Ruby:** Verify `RUBYGEMS_KEY` is set correctly
-   **Rust:** Verify `CARGO_TOKEN` is set correctly
-   **Kotlin:** Verify `MAVEN_USERNAME`, `MAVEN_PASSWORD`, and `GPG_KEY` are set
-   **Lua:** Verify `LUA_API_KEY` is set correctly
-   **Perl:** Verify `PAUSE_USERNAME` and `PAUSE_PASSWORD` are set

### Tests Pass Locally But Fail in CI

-   Check language versions in CI match your local environment
-   Ensure all dependencies are listed in language-specific manifests
-   Review the test-matrix job output for the specific language that failed
-   Run `./strling clean <lang> && ./strling setup <lang> && ./strling test <lang>` locally

### Deployment Skipped

-   Verify you pushed a **tag** (not just a commit): `git push --tags`
-   Ensure the tag matches semver format: `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-alpha`
-   Check that test-matrix completed successfully
-   Review the deployment job logs for the `if` condition evaluation
-   Verify the version doesn't already exist in the target registry (idempotent check)

### Version Already Published

-   Package registries don't allow re-publishing the same version
-   Update version in `bindings/python/pyproject.toml` (SSOT)
-   Run `python3 tooling/sync_versions.py --write` to propagate
-   Create a new tag matching the new version

## Version Management

STRling uses a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** approach for version management:

**SSOT Location:** `bindings/python/pyproject.toml`

**Workflow:**

1. Update version in `bindings/python/pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [project]
   version = "3.0.0-alpha"  # Update this only
   ```

2. Run the version propagation script:
   ```bash
   python3 tooling/sync_versions.py --write
   ```

3. The script automatically updates all other binding manifests:
   - TypeScript: `bindings/typescript/package.json`
   - Rust: `bindings/rust/Cargo.toml`
   - C#: `bindings/csharp/src/STRling/STRling.csproj`
   - F#: `bindings/fsharp/src/STRling/STRling.fsproj`
   - Ruby: `bindings/ruby/strling.gemspec`
   - Dart: `bindings/dart/pubspec.yaml`
   - Kotlin: `bindings/kotlin/build.gradle.kts`
   - Lua: `bindings/lua/strling-scm-1.rockspec`
   - And all other bindings...

**Rule:** Never manually edit version numbers in non-Python manifests. Always use the SSOT + propagation workflow.

**Note:** The TypeScript binding is the Logic SSOT (reference implementation), but Python is the Versioning SSOT. This separation ensures clarity of responsibility.

## Monitoring

Monitor workflow runs:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on "STRling CI/CD Pipeline"
3. View recent runs and their status
4. Click on individual runs to see detailed logs for each job

## Security Best Practices

-   ✅ Never commit secrets to the repository
-   ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive tokens
-   ✅ Regularly rotate API tokens
-   ✅ Use scoped tokens (limit to specific packages when possible)
-   ✅ Review published packages after deployment
